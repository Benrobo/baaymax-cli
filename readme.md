## BaayMax-Cli 😎

>Hey everyone, I wanted to let you all know that I have decided to archive the BaayMax repository. As many of you know, BaayMax is a tool for developers to generate intuitive, unique, and flexible portfolio sites. While it has been a useful tool for many of you, my schedule has become too busy to properly maintain it. However, I am not abandoning the project completely! I have plans to build a much more stable release and version of BaayMax that will not only be accessible for developers, but also for designers and non-developers. My goal is to create a product that is useful for a wider range of users and can be easily accessed and used by anyone. Thank you for your understanding and support as I work towards creating a better product. Stay tuned for updates on the new release of BaayMax!
